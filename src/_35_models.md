While Scalatra does not provide a native structure for models the
following persistence libraries are a few that have been successfully
integrated.

### For RDBMSs:

* [ScalaQuery](http://scalaquery.org)
* [Squeryl](http://squeryl.org/)

### For MongoDb:

* [Casbah](https://github.com/JanxSpirit/scalatra-mongodb.g8)
* [Lift Record](http://www.liftweb.com/)
* [Mongo Record](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/lift-mongodb-record)
* [Rogue](http://engineering.foursquare.com/2011/01/21/rogue-a-type-safe-scala-dsl-for-querying-mongodb/)
